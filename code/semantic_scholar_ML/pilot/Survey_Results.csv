The effect of being a Black author is likely reinforced when the team is racially diverse, as diversity supports open discourse and inclusion of underrepresented narratives. Together, these factors reinforce the likelihood of inequality being mentioned.

2. white × authors_race_diversity_score → Negative (−)
The effect of team diversity may dilute the influence of White authors on the focus of inequality, possibly due to reduced salience of the issue for them or the shifting team dynamics. Hence, the variables weaken each other’s influence on the outcome.

3. social_science × black → Positive (+)

A larger team size increases the likelihood of diverse viewpoints, and when at least one author is strongly identified as female (high female_score_max), it further enhances the team's potential to raise issues related to inequality. The presence of a highly feminine perspective in a larger, possibly more interdisciplinary team could encourage broader attention to social justice topics.

2. num_authors × first_author_female_score → Positive (+)
When the team is larger and the first author is likely female, this combination may amplify the probability of discussing inequality. The first author typically leads the paper and sets the framing of the research. A female lead within a broad team can ensure that inequality-related themes are prioritized and integrated into the manuscript.

3. female_score_max × first_author_female_score → Positive (+)
A high female_score_max means that someone on the team is strongly female-identified, while a high first_author_female_score means the leading voice is also female. Together, this suggests alignment in values and priorities around issues like representation and fairness.

Diverse research teams are often more attuned to social issues such as race inequality, as their members may bring different lived experiences and perspectives related to discrimination, representation, and justice. This diversity can foster greater awareness and motivation to address inequality in their academic work, making it more likely that such papers mention race-related issues.

Female scholars may be more inclined to study topics related to inequality due to personal experiences or a stronger orientation toward social justice. This tendency is especially pronounced in the social sciences, where race and identity are common areas of inquiry. Therefore, the presence of a high proportion of female authors in a social science paper is likely to amplify the probability that the paper discusses race inequality—more than either factor would suggest on its own.
social_science × female_score_avg → ( + )Female researchers are generally more likely to engage with topics related to social justice and inequality. In social science disciplines, where such topics are more central, this tendency is further reinforced. Therefore, when a paper is authored within the social sciences and also has a higher average proportion of female authors, the likelihood of discussing race inequality increases more than would be expected from either factor alone. This indicates a positive interaction between the field and author gender composition.

When authors are based in countries with high racial diversity, they are more likely to encounter race-related issues in public discourse and academic debate.

white → ( + ) In many academic institutions, particularly in Western countries, white scholars have been historically central to the development of gender studies and feminist theory. These authors may be more embedded in research traditions, networks, and discourse communities that focus on gender inequality. As a result, papers with more white authors—especially in the social sciences—may be more likely to discuss gender-related issues.
female_score_avg → ( + )Papers with a higher average proportion of female authors are more likely to discuss gender inequality. This is because female scholars may be more attuned to issues of gender-based discrimination through personal experience or scholarly interest. Based on both empirical studies and personal observation, women in academia are more engaged with gender justice topics than men, especially in social science disciplines.
female_score_max → ( + )The presence of at least one highly gender-aware or feminist-oriented female author can significantly increase the likelihood that a paper addresses gender inequality. In many cases, a single passionate scholar can set the research agenda for a team, especially in collaborative work. Therefore, the maximum female score is a strong indicator of the potential presence of gender-related themes in the paper.
country_race_diversity_score → ( + )Based on personal research experience, authors based in racially diverse countries are more likely to be exposed to public debates and academic conversations around equality, justice, and representation. In such environments, issues of gender inequality often intersect with race, identity, and class, making them more visible and salient.

In contrast, fields like natural sciences, engineering, and technology usually do not focus on these kinds of issues as much.

When it comes to the authors, a higher proportion of white authors is negatively associated with papers on race inequality. It seems to me that white authors may have less direct engagement with or exposure to these experiences. The same goes for Asian authors—a higher proportion of Asian authors is also negatively associated. This might be because their research tends to focus on other priorities, or maybe because race-related issues are less emphasized in their academic environments. Also, I think many Asian authors come from countries where Asians are the racial majority, so, like white authors, they may have less personal or direct engagement with racial inequality.

Gender also makes a difference. Papers with a balanced or average level of female representation are more likely to focus on race inequality. That might be because gender-diverse teams tend to be more aware of social issues in general. If the first author is a woman, that is another positive sign, and it could suggest that women are more likely to take the lead on topics related to social justice and systemic inequality.","social_science,first_author_female_score","white,asian","white,first_author_female_score",+,-,+,"When a paper has both a social science focus and a female first author, the positive effect of each becomes stronger.

When both Asian and white authors are present, the negative effect of each group on its own becomes less strong. That mix might bring a bit more diversity in perspective or reduce blind spots that can come from working within a single dominant racial context.

When a paper has both a white author group and a female first author, the combination actually strengthens the positive influence.

Papers from countries with high racial diversity are also more likely to address gender equality. These countries often have more open discussions about social justice in general, and gender is usually a key part of that conversation.

When a paper combines social science with being from a country with high racial diversity, the effect is also stronger. Social science already leans toward studying inequality, and diverse countries often have a stronger culture of discussing social justice. This combination increases the chances that gender equality becomes a key topic.

When a paper combines social science and a white author group, the positive influence on focusing on gender equality becomes stronger.

First, I expect the number of Black authors to have a positive effect, as scholars from racially marginalized backgrounds are more likely to engage with issues of racial injustice. Second, papers classified within the social science domain are also more likely to mention inequality-related terms, given the field's orientation toward structural and societal analysis. Conversely, being categorized under engineering and technology is expected to have a negative effect, as such disciplines are generally less focused on social or political topics. I also include two structural team-level indicators: the authors' race diversity score, which captures within-group heterogeneity and is expected to be positively associated with race discourse, and the average female probability score (female_score_avg), as gender diversity may correlate with greater attention to social justice themes. Together, these features reflect a combination of author identity, disciplinary framing, and team composition, which jointly shape the discourse on race inequality.","social_science,black","black,authors_race_diversity_score","social_science,female_score_avg",+,-,+,"The interaction between social_science and black is expected to have a positive effect because race-related discourse is most likely to emerge when both author identity and disciplinary structure align. Black scholars are more likely to bring personal or community experience with racial inequality, and the social sciences offer an academic space where such issues are institutionally legitimate and theoretically relevant.

In contrast, the interaction between black and authors_race_diversity_score is assigned a negative sign. While team diversity may appear conducive to discussing race, in practice, it can introduce pressures to maintain consensus or avoid controversial topics. In highly diverse teams, Black scholars might be less likely to foreground race-related issues if they anticipate disagreement or marginalization within the group.

Lastly, the interaction between social_science and female_score_avg is assigned a positive sign. Female scholars, particularly in the social sciences, are often more engaged with social justice topics, including race. When the field's focus and the team's gender composition align, the likelihood of race inequality discourse increases through both normative and affective channels.","social_science,engineering_and_technology,female_score_avg,first_author_female_score,authors_race_diversity_score",1,,5,,,,,,,2,,,3,4,,+,,-,,,,,,,+,,,+,+,,"Papers authored by teams with a higher average probability of being female (female_score_avg) are more likely to discuss gender inequality, reflecting both personal experience and awareness of structural gender issues. Similarly, when the first author is female (first_author_female_score), the likelihood increases, as this author often sets the framing and tone of the paper.

Papers published in social science domains are more likely to mention gender inequality because these disciplines provide both the theoretical language and normative openness for such discussions. In contrast, engineering_and_technology papers are less likely to engage with gender issues, both due to disciplinary norms and historically lower female representation.

Lastly, authors_race_diversity_score may positively contribute, as diverse teams may be more attuned to broader forms of social inequality and more open to intersectional discourse, including gender. While this effect may vary by context, I assume that in collaborative academic settings, such diversity facilitates rather than hinders gender-related discourse.","social_science,female_score_avg","engineering_and_technology,female_score_avg","female_score_avg,authors_race_diversity_score",+,-,+,"The interaction between social_science and female_score_avg is expected to have a positive effect. Social science disciplines tend to be more engaged with inequality-related discourse, and a higher average probability of female authorship further increases the likelihood of addressing gender inequality. These two features reinforce each other, as female scholars in social science may be especially attuned to gender-based disparities.

The interaction between engineering_and_technology and female_score_avg is expected to have a negative effect. Although gender imbalance in engineering is a known issue, teams with more female authors in this field may face institutional or disciplinary constraints that discourage explicit discussions of gender inequality. Thus, even when female representation increases, the norms of the field may suppress related discourse, leading to a negative interaction.

The interaction between female_score_avg and authors_race_diversity_score is anticipated to have a positive effect. Teams with higher gender and racial diversity are more likely to recognize and address intersectional forms of inequality. This combination fosters an environment where gender inequality is more visible and more likely to be discussed, especially when these diverse perspectives are meaningfully integrated into the research.","Yes — I believe a feature capturing whether the paper uses qualitative methods or interviews could be relevant, as these approaches are often used in studies explicitly focused on inequality.","One point of confusion I encountered was the definition of ""importance.""

I believe that papers discussing racial inequality primarily belong to the domain of social sciences, rather than Engineering & Technology or Natural Sciences. Therefore, based on this prior knowledge and applying Bayesian theory, the probability that a paper discusses racial inequality is naturally far greater if it falls within the social sciences compared to Engineering & Technology or Natural Sciences. Consequently, if a paper belongs to the fields of Engineering & Technology or Natural Sciences, it is highly unlikely to discuss racial inequality, whereas a paper in the social sciences is more likely to do so.

Second is the authors' race. I consider this factor to have, at most, a weak correlation. However, as the other options seemed even less relevant/correlated, I still opted for two minority authors feature. My reasoning is as follows: If authors belong to minority groups, they are naturally likely to be more concerned about the injustices faced by themselves and their communities, making it more probable that they would address such topics. Furthermore, authors from minority backgrounds might also be more likely to receive funding to research issues of racial inequality(just from my point of view).","social_science,native_hawaiian","engineering_and_technology,asian","social_science,black",+,+,+,"For these three feature pairs, I selected combinations structured as (Paper Field, Minority Group). The reasoning is similar to my previous explanation.

First, I want to discuss the selection of (Engineering & Technology, Asian). Based on my own prior knowledge, Asians (especially Chinese people) tend to pay less attention to the phenomenon of racial inequality. Combined with the paper being in the Engineering & Technology field, this tendency becomes even more pronounced. If the paper's field were Social Sciences instead of Engineering & Technology, it would actually be harder to make a judgment, so I believe these two features (field and race) reinforce each other in this case.

Next, let's discuss the feature pairs (Social Sciences, Black) and (Social Sciences, Native Hawaiian). The logic is similar: when a paper belongs to the social sciences and the authors are from these minority groups (Black, Native Hawaiian), I believe they would be more inclined to focus on issues of racial inequality.","social_science,natural_science,engineering_and_technology,female_score_avg,first_author_female_score",1,2,3,,,,,,,5,,,4,,,+,-,-,,,,,,,+,,,+,,,"Following similar logic, the selection of social_science, natural_science, engineering_and_technology, female_score_avg, and first_author_female_score is based on domain relevance and author characteristics. My prior understanding suggests papers discussing gender inequality predominantly belong to social_science, making its presence a strong positive indicator, while affiliation with natural_science or engineering_and_technology would make such a topic less probable.

Consequently, their interaction effect is expected to be negative, as they largely capture overlapping information, potentially diminishing each other's unique contribution when considered together. 

In contrast, the interaction between social_science and either female_score_avg or first_author_female_score is positive. This stems from the belief that researchers with higher female scores working within the social sciences are particularly likely to engage with and study broad societal issues like gender inequality, meaning the field context reinforces the predictive effect of the author score.","In my view, the feature should include at least the following: the declaration status of government funding, and the type of the author's affiliation (e.g., private, public, or miscellaneous)","The background information provided for this survey is quite clear, but I felt that many of the selected features don't seem strongly correlated with inequality. This made me quite hesitant when responding to certain options.

Perhaps a series of scenarios could be designed to make the features more concrete, asking participants to judge which has a greater impact. For example:

Suppose there are two papers. The first is research on neural networks (or any engineering/technical topic), and the author is of Asian descent. The second is research on African hunting culture, and the author belongs to an ethnic minority group. Then, based on this, ask me which paper is more likely to discuss issues of racial inequality.

However, this kind of design might make the judgment too simplistic, so the specific implementation would require further consideration.","About 1 hour.

Social Science
Race inequality is a major social issue and papers in the social science field are much more likely to look into and talk about issues related to society. Unlike fields like natural science, which focus on things like the physical world, social science is related to understanding human behavior, relationships, and social structures. So, it makes sense that social science papers are more likely to discuss race inequality.

When we look at the experiences, problems, or difficulties that black people encounter, these often have a lot to do with race inequality. For example, issues like discrimination in employment, education, or criminal justice that black individuals face are all part of the broader topic of race inequality. So, if a paper mentions “black” in its title or abstract, it might be discussing race inequality.

3. Asian
   Just like “black,” “Asian” refers to a particular ethnic group whose skin color is yellow. Papers that focus on this community are likely to touch on race related inequalities. Asian people also face various forms of discrimination, whether it’s in housing, access to services, or in how they are represented in society. So, when a paper is about the community, it could very well be addressing race inequality issues.


4. Country Race Diversity Score
   The country where the research is done or where the authors are from matters. In a more racially diverse country, there are more race-related situations and issues. This increases the chances that a paper will find race inequality to be a relevant topic. For instance, in a country with a large number of different racial groups living together, there are bound to be more cases of discrimination and inequality that researchers might want to study.

5. Authors Race Diversity Score
    If the authors’ race diversity score is high, it means that the group of authors comes from a wide range of racial backgrounds. A more diverse group of authors is more likely to talk about race-related topics, including race inequality. They would probably bring different perspectives and experiences. 
","black,country_race_diversity_score","asian,authors_race_diversity_score","social_science,country_race_diversity_score",+,+,+,"1. ""Black"" and ""Country Race Diversity Score""
- Reason for Importance: ""Black"" refers to a specific racial group that has long - standing experiences of racial inequality, which is a key group in the study of racial inequality. The ""Country Race Diversity Score"" reflects the degree of racial diversity in a country. In countries with a high level of racial diversity, there is more frequent contact and interaction among different racial groups. The relationship between black people and other races, as well as the inequality issues, may makes them more likely to become the focus of research. For instance, in the US where the racial diversity is high, the inequality issues that black people face in education, employment, and the judicial system have long been important topics in social science research.
- Effect Sign Justification: There is a positive interaction (+) between the two. As the country's race diversity score increases, the interactions between black people and other races become more frequent, and the racial inequality issues they face become more prominent. This may brought about more research and discussion on the racial inequality experienced by black people. 

2. ""Asian"" and ""Authors Race Diversity Score""
- Reason for Importance: ""Asian"" is also a racial group that has unique experiences and faces various race related issues in different regions. The ""Authors Race Diversity Score"" reflects the racial diversity of the research team. When the diversity of the author group is high, there is a greater possibility of Asian authors being involved. They can provide insights on the racial inequality of Asian people from their own perspective. Moreover, authors from different races can interact and inspire each other, which promotes more comprehensive research covering the racial inequality issues of various races.
- Effect Sign Justification: This is also a positive interaction (+). As the authors' race diversity score increases, the opportunity for Asian authors to participate in research increases, and they are likely to integrate the racial inequality issues faced by Asian people into the research. 

3.  ""Social Science"" and ""Country Race Diversity Score""
- Reason for Importance: The ""Social Science"" field focuses on the study of lots of social phenomena and human behaviors, in which racial inequality is an important category. The ""Country Race Diversity Score"" reflects the average diversity of the authors’ affiliated countries. Higher values indicate greater racial diversity in the authors' affiliated countries. Countries with rich racial diversity provide abundant social reality materials and research backgrounds, offering more cases and research opportunities for social research on racial inequality. In such an environment, social science researchers are more likely to encounter various racial inequality phenomena, which prompts them to conduct relevant research and discuss them in papers.
- Effect Sign Justification: This is also a positive interaction (+). When the country's race diversity score is high, social science researchers have more opportunities to observe and explore racial inequality issues.

   Papers in social science are much more likely to deal with gender inequality compared to those in natural science or engineering. This is because gender inequality is an important topic in this area. 
2. Female Score Avg
   When a research team has a higher percentage of female authors, they're more likely to look into gender related problems. So, the average female score can be a strong sign. 
3. First Author Female Score
   The first author usually can determine what the paper focuses on. If the first author is female, the paper is more likely to talk about gender inequality. They can set the direction of the research, and if they care about women's issues, they'll probably include things like how women don't get the same chances as men in different areas.
4. Female Score Max
   If there's at least one author who really identifies strongly as female, it could have an impact on what the paper is about. However, this isn't as strong as the average female score or the gender of the first author. But still, their presence can make the paper more likely to touch on gender related topics.
5. Authors Race Diversity Score
   Even though it's not directly about gender, when there's a lot of diversity in the race of the authors, it often goes along with research that cares about fairness in general, and that includes gender inequality. When authors are from different racial backgrounds, they bring different views. They might see how gender inequality can be different for women of different races. ","social_science,female_score_avg","social_science,first_author_female_score","female_score_avg,authors_race_diversity_score",+,+,+,"Here is the analysis for the interactions between the given pairs of factors:

1. social science × female score avg
- Importance of the interaction: Social science disciplines are more inclined to study inequalities, including gender inequality. Female researchers, due to their own experiences, may be more likely to focus on gender - related issues. When the average proportion of female authors (female_score_avg) in a research team is high and the research field is social science, there is a greater chance that the paper will discuss gender inequality. 
- Sign of the effect: The effect is positive. As the value of social science increases, and at the same time, the female score avg increases, the probability that the paper will discuss gender inequality also increases. 

2. first author female score × social science
- Importance of the interaction: The first author usually has a significant influence on the research direction. If the first author is female, she may be more inclined to study gender related issues. When this is combined with the paper being in the social science field, the likelihood of discussing gender inequality is further enhanced. 
- Sign of the effect: The interaction is positive. When the social science factor indicates a higher probability, and the first author female score is also high, the two factors work together to increase the likelihood of the paper discussing gender inequality. 

3. female score avg × authors race diversity score
- Importance of the interaction:Female authors in the research team. Female authors may be more sensitive to gender related issues. A high authors race diversity score indicates a diverse research team in terms of race. Such diversity can bring in different perspectives, which may lead to a broader consideration of social inequality issues, including gender inequality. 
- Sign of the effect: The effect is positive. As the female score avg increases, indicating more female related research interests, and the authors race diversity score also increases, representing a more diverse research team with different perspectives, they jointly promote the exploration of gender inequality.

First, you use feature engineering techniques to classify the inequality or not of the paper with multiple tasks (gender, race, general). Second, you use econometrics to explore important features' main and moderation effects with heterogeneous groups (gender, race, general). 

2. I have a project with a similar methodology framework but different topics. Here are my observations:

2.1 Why do you use these features for classification rather than pre-trained language such as BERT for text embedding or combining BERT and your listed features for better prediction results? 

2.2 The features you choose should have theory/empirical results (from literature)/intuitive logic (as we input as subjects) to support why they are relevant for your target variable. Otherwise, it is ad hoc because we can extract many features from the text papers. 

2.3 The feature engineering design is inherently interpretable compared with BERT embedding-based methods. This raises a question about the motivation and value of your Econometric and heterogeneous analysis based on the features. The reviewers might have questions regarding Model specifications (e.g., you can choose many combinations of main IV and moderators, so why this IV and moderator rather than others?), confounders, and endogeneity issues.

I hope my observations are helpful for your research even harsh.

female_score_avg Sign: + Theoretical Explanation: The average female score indicates the proportion of female authors in a paper. Female scholars are generally more inclined to address gender inequality issues. Therefore, papers with a higher proportion of female authors are more likely to discuss topics related to gender inequality. Thus, a higher value for this feature is associated with a higher probability of mentioning gender inequality.
first_author_female_score Sign: + Theoretical Explanation: When the first author is female, the paper is more likely to focus on gender inequality issues. Female first authors are often more sensitive to gender-related problems, and their research is more likely to address these issues. Therefore, a higher value for this feature is associated with a higher probability of discussing gender inequality.
authors_race_diversity_score Sign: + Theoretical Explanation: A racially diverse author team is more likely to pay attention to multiple forms of inequality, including gender inequality. In intersectionality research, race and gender are often important topics that are addressed together. Therefore, higher racial diversity among authors increases the likelihood of discussing gender inequality as part of broader inequality discussions.
female_score_min Sign: - Theoretical Explanation: The minimum female score represents the lowest proportion of female authors in a paper's author group. When this value is low (approaching zero), it indicates a predominantly male team with minimal female participation. Such teams are less likely to discuss gender inequality issues. Therefore, a lower female score minimum is negatively associated with discussions of gender innequality.
","social_science,female_score_avg","social_science,first_author_female_score","female_score_min,authors_race_diversity_score",+,+,+,"1. social_science × female_score_avg
Sign: +
Explanation:
Papers in social science fields are generally more likely to talk about gender inequality. These fields are where conversations about social structures, gender roles, and discrimination tend to happen.
A higher average female score (meaning more women involved) boosts the chances of discussing gender inequality. Women researchers are often more sensitive to gender issues, especially in disciplines already focused on social justice.
Why Positive? When a paper is both in social science and has a higher proportion of female authors, those two factors reinforce each other, making it much more likely that gender inequality will be a topic.

2. first_author_female_score × social_science
Sign: +
Explanation:
When the first author is female, there's a higher likelihood that the paper will discuss gender inequality. The first author usually sets the direction and focus of the research, so their perspective matters a lot.
Being in a social science field adds even more weight to this effect since these disciplines often focus on inequality and discrimination.
Why Positive? Female first authors working within social science fields are particularly likely to address gender inequality issues. These two features work together to make gender inequality discussions much more likely.

3. female_score_min × authors_race_diversity_score
Sign: +
Explanation:
When the minimum female score is high, it suggests that all authors on a paper have relatively high female probabilities, indicating either a strong female presence or even an all-female team. This is important because female representation influences whether gender inequality is addressed.
A high racial diversity score means the author team is diverse in terms of racial backgrounds. Diverse teams are more likely to tackle complex inequality issues, including those involving gender.
Why Positive? When a diverse team also has strong female representation, it’s more likely to consider gender inequality, especially through an intersectional lens that looks at both gender and race.
","funding_diversity_score: A score indicating whether the paper was funded by organizations focused on diversity or inequality issues.
Papers funded by organizations that focus on equality, diversity, or social justice are more likely to address these issues in their content. Funding sources play a role in shaping the research direction.

Let's talk about black and Hispanic writers. The two groups may have shared experiences and perspectives on racial issues, and their collaboration may be more focused on issues of racial inequality. When the number of authors from these two groups increases, it may work together to drive papers that explore racial inequality.
Finally, the combination of gender characteristics and ethnic diversity is also important.

Their academic work often addresses marginalized communities, reflecting a commitment to equity, inclusion, and challenging dominant societal narratives.
A smaller author_race_diversity_score indicates less racial diversity among authors, often reflecting a more homogeneous group. This homogeneity may lead to greater awareness of the lack of representation or social imbalance, prompting authors to more explicitly address inequality-related issues. Alternatively, less diverse teams may consciously strive to demonstrate social awareness by including such terms. This association suggests that lower diversity can heighten sensitivity to inequality, either through self-reflection or compensatory signaling in academic or public discourse.
Fewer Asian authors may correlate with more inequality-related terms due to Western scholars' greater emphasis on social justice, diversity, and critical discourse. Cultural, institutional, or editorial norms in Western academia often prioritize such themes, while Asian authors may focus more on technical or policy-oriented aspects, reflecting regional academic priorities.
A higher country_race_diversity_score reflects greater racial heterogeneity, which may heighten awareness of social disparities and systemic inequalities. This increased diversity can lead to more public discourse and sensitivity around equity issues, thereby increasing the likelihood of mentioning inequality-related words in national or institutional communications.
A higher proportion of Native Hawaiians may be associated with greater mentions of inequality-related words due to their historical and ongoing experiences of social, economic, and political marginalization. These lived realities likely heighten awareness and discourse around inequality, prompting more frequent expression of related concerns in various communication contexts.

This may be because such environments provide greater visibility and discourse around racial issues, enabling Black authors to engage more openly with topics of inequality. Additionally, diverse societies often experience more active social movements, institutional responses, and academic interest in race-related issues, which may influence authors’ writing. The interaction effect captures how individual identity and broader sociocultural context together shape the salience of inequality in scholarly or public discourse.
The negative sign in the interaction between Black authors and the authors' race diversity score may indicate that as the racial diversity of coauthors increases, the likelihood of a Black author emphasizing certain themes (e.g., inequality-related words) decreases. This could reflect a shift in discourse dynamics within more racially diverse teams, where individual authors may adjust language or focus in response to group norms, shared authorship priorities, or editorial expectations. Additionally, it may suggest that in more diverse teams, the burden of addressing race-related issues may become diffused, leading to a reduction in the individual salience of such topics.

Their lived experiences with discrimination or underrepresentation may sensitize them to broader patterns of inequality, influencing both the language and themes of their work. This tendency reflects a broader pattern where marginalized voices are more attuned to and vocal about issues of inequality.
Social science topics are often associated with a higher probability of mentioning inequality-related words because these disciplines, such as sociology, political science, and economics, directly address societal structures, power dynamics, and human behavior. Inequality is a central concern within social sciences, which aim to understand, critique, and address disparities in wealth, power, and opportunity.

There are many discussions about race, especially black in the US (see BLV movement) so I picked black over the other races.","authors_race_diversity_score,country_race_diversity_score","social_science,authors_race_diversity_score","black,country_race_diversity_score",+,+,+,"great diversity reinforces each other, and finally also has a positive effect on whether the paper discusses race inequality","social_science,white,asian,female_score_avg,first_author_female_score",2,,,,4,,5,,,3,,,1,,,+,,,,+,,-,,,+,,,+,,,"Social science papers often look at gender behavior differences in psychology or sociology. I think feminism is more of a big topic in the western world, that's why I picked white. I think countries in Asia are less likely to talk about feminism, it's not really a thing there (yet). I have the imagine that they prefer to follow traditions, so they wouldn't really do much research on that, I put it on negative. I think that oftentimes the first author of such papers is female because they are the most affected by this and there are also some unspoken ethical guidelines/practice that the lead author should be part of this marginalized group, in this case female. I think male authors would feel awkward leading such research when they are not affected or have experienced gender inequality much.","social_science,first_author_female_score","female_score_avg,first_author_female_score","white,first_author_female_score",+,+,+,I think the first author being female coupled with any other positive feature that speaks for feminism would reinforce their influence on gender inequality,"Political and legal situation of the country where the authors are located (e.g. LGBTQ+ friendly, freedom of speech, right vs left-wing).
