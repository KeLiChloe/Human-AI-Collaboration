First, in multicultural societies like the United States or the UK, Asian scholars often belong to minority communities and may be more aware of racial dynamics through personal or professional experiences.

Second, if race inequality becomes a widely discussed or “hot” topic in the academic community, it may attract more attention from Asian researchers seeking to contribute to socially relevant and visible areas of scholarship.

Female scholars may be more inclined to study topics related to inequality due to personal experiences or a stronger orientation toward social justice.

In social science disciplines, where such topics are more central, this tendency is further reinforced. Therefore, when a paper is authored within the social sciences and also has a higher average proportion of female authors, the likelihood of discussing race inequality increases more than would be expected from either factor alone. This indicates a positive interaction between the field and author gender composition.
social_science × country_race_diversity_score → ( + Social science disciplines are more oriented toward exploring identity, inequality, and cultural diversity. When authors are based in countries with high racial diversity, they are more likely to encounter race-related issues in public discourse and academic debate.

When it comes to the authors, a higher proportion of white authors is negatively associated with papers on race inequality. It seems to me that white authors may have less direct engagement with or exposure to these experiences. The same goes for Asian authors—a higher proportion of Asian authors is also negatively associated. This might be because their research tends to focus on other priorities, or maybe because race-related issues are less emphasized in their academic environments. Also, I think many Asian authors come from countries where Asians are the racial majority, so, like white authors, they may have less personal or direct engagement with racial inequality.

Gender also makes a difference. Papers with a balanced or average level of female representation are more likely to focus on race inequality. That might be because gender-diverse teams tend to be more aware of social issues in general.

When both Asian and white authors are present, the negative effect of each group on its own becomes less strong. That mix might bring a bit more diversity in perspective or reduce blind spots that can come from working within a single dominant racial context.

When a paper has both a white author group and a female first author, the combination actually strengthens the positive influence. The female lead seems to bring in a stronger focus on social issues, and in this case, helps shift the group’s work more toward race inequality."

First, I expect the number of Black authors to have a positive effect, as scholars from racially marginalized backgrounds are more likely to engage with issues of racial injustice. Second, papers classified within the social science domain are also more likely to mention inequality-related terms, given the field's orientation toward structural and societal analysis. Conversely, being categorized under engineering and technology is expected to have a negative effect, as such disciplines are generally less focused on social or political topics. I also include two structural team-level indicators: the authors' race diversity score, which captures within-group heterogeneity and is expected to be positively associated with race discourse, and the average female probability score (female_score_avg), as gender diversity may correlate with greater attention to social justice themes. Together, these features reflect a combination of author identity, disciplinary framing, and team composition, which jointly shape the discourse on race inequality.","social_science,black","black,authors_race_diversity_score","social_science,female_score_avg",+,-,+,"The interaction between social_science and black is expected to have a positive effect because race-related discourse is most likely to emerge when both author identity and disciplinary structure align. Black scholars are more likely to bring personal or community experience with racial inequality, and the social sciences offer an academic space where such issues are institutionally legitimate and theoretically relevant.

In contrast, the interaction between black and authors_race_diversity_score is assigned a negative sign. While team diversity may appear conducive to discussing race, in practice, it can introduce pressures to maintain consensus or avoid controversial topics. In highly diverse teams, Black scholars might be less likely to foreground race-related issues if they anticipate disagreement or marginalization within the group.

Lastly, the interaction between social_science and female_score_avg is assigned a positive sign. Female scholars, particularly in the social sciences, are often more engaged with social justice topics, including race. When the field's focus and the team's gender composition align, the likelihood of race inequality discourse increases through both normative and affective channels."
Zhengqin Lai,M,PhD Student,Harbin Institute of Technology,computer vision,"Advanced (e.g., conducted ML related research or implemented ML/AI models)",34.0544,-118.244,"social_science,natural_science,engineering_and_technology,black,native_hawaiian",1,2,3,,,4,,5,,,,,,,,+,-,-,,,+,,+,,,,,,,,"First, regarding the paper's field. I believe that papers discussing racial inequality primarily belong to the domain of social sciences, rather than Engineering & Technology or Natural Sciences. Therefore, based on this prior knowledge and applying Bayesian theory, the probability that a paper discusses racial inequality is naturally far greater if it falls within the social sciences compared to Engineering & Technology or Natural Sciences. Consequently, if a paper belongs to the fields of Engineering & Technology or Natural Sciences, it is highly unlikely to discuss racial inequality, whereas a paper in the social sciences is more likely to do so.

Second is the authors' race. I consider this factor to have, at most, a weak correlation. However, as the other options seemed even less relevant/correlated, I still opted for two minority authors feature. My reasoning is as follows: If authors belong to minority groups, they are naturally likely to be more concerned about the injustices faced by themselves and their communities, making it more probable that they would address such topics. Furthermore, authors from minority backgrounds might also be more likely to receive funding to research issues of racial inequality(just from my point of view).","social_science,native_hawaiian","engineering_and_technology,asian","social_science,black",+,+,+,"For these three feature pairs, I selected combinations structured as (Paper Field, Minority Group). The reasoning is similar to my previous explanation.

First, I want to discuss the selection of (Engineering & Technology, Asian). Based on my own prior knowledge, Asians (especially Chinese people) tend to pay less attention to the phenomenon of racial inequality. Combined with the paper being in the Engineering & Technology field, this tendency becomes even more pronounced. If the paper's field were Social Sciences instead of Engineering & Technology, it would actually be harder to make a judgment, so I believe these two features (field and race) reinforce each other in this case.

Next, let's discuss the feature pairs (Social Sciences, Black) and (Social Sciences, Native Hawaiian). The logic is similar: when a paper belongs to the social sciences and the authors are from these minority groups (Black, Native Hawaiian), I believe they would be more inclined to focus on issues of racial inequality."

Social Science
Race inequality is a major social issue and papers in the social science field are much more likely to look into and talk about issues related to society. Unlike fields like natural science, which focus on things like the physical world, social science is related to understanding human behavior, relationships, and social structures. So, it makes sense that social science papers are more likely to discuss race inequality.

2. Black
   ""Black"" directly refers to a specific racial groupwhose skin color is black. When we look at the experiences, problems, or difficulties that black people encounter, these often have a lot to do with race inequality. For example, issues like discrimination in employment, education, or criminal justice that black individuals face are all part of the broader topic of race inequality. So, if a paper mentions “black” in its title or abstract, it might be discussing race inequality.

3. Asian
   Just like “black,” “Asian” refers to a particular ethnic group whose skin color is yellow. Papers that focus on this community are likely to touch on race related inequalities. Asian people also face various forms of discrimination, whether it’s in housing, access to services, or in how they are represented in society. So, when a paper is about the community, it could very well be addressing race inequality issues.


4. Country Race Diversity Score
   The country where the research is done or where the authors are from matters. In a more racially diverse country, there are more race-related situations and issues. This increases the chances that a paper will find race inequality to be a relevant topic. For instance, in a country with a large number of different racial groups living together, there are bound to be more cases of discrimination and inequality that researchers might want to study.

5. Authors Race Diversity Score
    If the authors’ race diversity score is high, it means that the group of authors comes from a wide range of racial backgrounds. A more diverse group of authors is more likely to talk about race-related topics, including race inequality. They would probably bring different perspectives and experiences. 
","black,country_race_diversity_score","asian,authors_race_diversity_score","social_science,country_race_diversity_score",+,+,+,"1. ""Black"" and ""Country Race Diversity Score""
- Reason for Importance: ""Black"" refers to a specific racial group that has long - standing experiences of racial inequality, which is a key group in the study of racial inequality. The ""Country Race Diversity Score"" reflects the degree of racial diversity in a country. In countries with a high level of racial diversity, there is more frequent contact and interaction among different racial groups. The relationship between black people and other races, as well as the inequality issues, may makes them more likely to become the focus of research. For instance, in the US where the racial diversity is high, the inequality issues that black people face in education, employment, and the judicial system have long been important topics in social science research.
- Effect Sign Justification: There is a positive interaction (+) between the two. As the country's race diversity score increases, the interactions between black people and other races become more frequent, and the racial inequality issues they face become more prominent. This may brought about more research and discussion on the racial inequality experienced by black people. 

2. ""Asian"" and ""Authors Race Diversity Score""
- Reason for Importance: ""Asian"" is also a racial group that has unique experiences and faces various race related issues in different regions. The ""Authors Race Diversity Score"" reflects the racial diversity of the research team. When the diversity of the author group is high, there is a greater possibility of Asian authors being involved. They can provide insights on the racial inequality of Asian people from their own perspective. Moreover, authors from different races can interact and inspire each other, which promotes more comprehensive research covering the racial inequality issues of various races.
- Effect Sign Justification: This is also a positive interaction (+). As the authors' race diversity score increases, the opportunity for Asian authors to participate in research increases, and they are likely to integrate the racial inequality issues faced by Asian people into the research. 

3.  ""Social Science"" and ""Country Race Diversity Score""
- Reason for Importance: The ""Social Science"" field focuses on the study of lots of social phenomena and human behaviors, in which racial inequality is an important category. The ""Country Race Diversity Score"" reflects the average diversity of the authors’ affiliated countries. Higher values indicate greater racial diversity in the authors' affiliated countries. Countries with rich racial diversity provide abundant social reality materials and research backgrounds, offering more cases and research opportunities for social research on racial inequality. In such an environment, social science researchers are more likely to encounter various racial inequality phenomena, which prompts them to conduct relevant research and discuss them in papers.
- Effect Sign Justification: This is also a positive interaction (+). When the country's race diversity score is high, social science researchers have more opportunities to observe and explore racial inequality issues. "

Their academic work often addresses marginalized communities, reflecting a commitment to equity, inclusion, and challenging dominant societal narratives.
A smaller author_race_diversity_score indicates less racial diversity among authors, often reflecting a more homogeneous group. This homogeneity may lead to greater awareness of the lack of representation or social imbalance, prompting authors to more explicitly address inequality-related issues. Alternatively, less diverse teams may consciously strive to demonstrate social awareness by including such terms. This association suggests that lower diversity can heighten sensitivity to inequality, either through self-reflection or compensatory signaling in academic or public discourse.
Fewer Asian authors may correlate with more inequality-related terms due to Western scholars' greater emphasis on social justice, diversity, and critical discourse. Cultural, institutional, or editorial norms in Western academia often prioritize such themes, while Asian authors may focus more on technical or policy-oriented aspects, reflecting regional academic priorities.
A higher country_race_diversity_score reflects greater racial heterogeneity, which may heighten awareness of social disparities and systemic inequalities. This increased diversity can lead to more public discourse and sensitivity around equity issues, thereby increasing the likelihood of mentioning inequality-related words in national or institutional communications.
A higher proportion of Native Hawaiians may be associated with greater mentions of inequality-related words due to their historical and ongoing experiences of social, economic, and political marginalization. These lived realities likely heighten awareness and discourse around inequality, prompting more frequent expression of related concerns in various communication contexts.

This may be because such environments provide greater visibility and discourse around racial issues, enabling Black authors to engage more openly with topics of inequality. Additionally, diverse societies often experience more active social movements, institutional responses, and academic interest in race-related issues, which may influence authors’ writing. The interaction effect captures how individual identity and broader sociocultural context together shape the salience of inequality in scholarly or public discourse.
The negative sign in the interaction between Black authors and the authors' race diversity score may indicate that as the racial diversity of coauthors increases, the likelihood of a Black author emphasizing certain themes (e.g., inequality-related words) decreases. This could reflect a shift in discourse dynamics within more racially diverse teams, where individual authors may adjust language or focus in response to group norms, shared authorship priorities, or editorial expectations. Additionally, it may suggest that in more diverse teams, the burden of addressing race-related issues may become diffused, leading to a reduction in the individual salience of such topics.
The positive sign on the interaction between Native Hawaiian authors and the country race diversity score suggests that Native Hawaiian authors are more likely to engage with or be influenced by diverse racial environments. In more racially diverse countries, these authors may feel a greater sense of inclusion or empowerment, leading to increased scholarly participation or expression, particularly on topics related to race, equity, and justice.
